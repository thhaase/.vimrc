# my vimrc setup

This repository is mainly for synching my vimrc between multiple PCs. I made it public because I enjoy looking at other peoples setups, so why not giving everyone the chance to see my setup

What I use Vim for:
- Latex
- ...

[F3 Toggles NERDTree] [F2 starts Latexautocompile with Zathura] [enabled auto:w]
Just stole it from somewhere on the web and finetuned it a little to fit my needs.


to make it work just put it in home/user/.vimrc
open with vim
type ":PlugInstall"
type :q 
enjoy
